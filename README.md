# TraSH
just a damn simple shell written in C

# Building
just run `make` and that's it (also make sure you have a C compiler installed).

# Features
For now it can only run basic commands and has only 3 built-in commands: `cd`, `help` and `exit`, also there is no support for pipes and other common Unix shell features.
